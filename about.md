## Me

Studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Surrey in the United Kingdom, working on a couple of startups with a few friends and also working on a couple of projects of my own that I would like to form into a business if possible at a later date.

I enjoy reading books, both non-fiction and fiction. Ill occasionally try to talk about interesting points in some of the books.

I enjoy gaming (see below).

## Development

All projects I work on that I have the ability to opensource will be uploaded to my [GitHub](https://github.com/uknj).

Source code, schema, 3D models, diagrams, documentation etc. etc. will be provided where possible, and I'll cover the steps I took with most of these projects so you can follow along! If you do decide to take my projects further, let me know what you did and how you did it!

## Gaming

I enjoy playing PC games. The main multiplayer games I play are

* League of Legends, IGN: uknj
* CS:GO (Counter Strike: Global Offensive), Steam IGN: uknj
* Robocraft, IGN: See Steam IGN above
* Hearthstone, IGN: uknj#1626.

In addition to this, I also spend time dabbling around in games like Civilisation 5, Crusader Kings II etc etc.

I also [stream](http://twitch.tv/uknj) on occasion. Feel free to follow me there.
