title: Book Review! Business Adventures, by John Brooks.
---

The first of what will hopefully be many reviews of books that I find intriguing and/or entertaining.

[Business Adventures](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4191136-business-adventures) is quite an old book, having been published in 1969. Regardless, I still found several facts surprisingly relevant to modern businesses and believe that the information and knowledge collected can be used even in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.

The author, John Brooks (1920â€“1993) was a writer and longtime contributor to The New Yorker magazine, where he worked for many years as a staff writer, specializing in financial topics. Brooks was also the author of several books, both fiction and non-fiction, the best known of which was an examination of the financial shenanigans of the 1960s Wall Street bull market.<sup>[1]</sup>

Bill Gates has claimed it is "The best business book I've ever read". It was first given to him by Warren Buffet back in 1991.<sup>[2]</sup> Bill Gates has reviewed the book and it can be found [here](http://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Business-Adventures). He even provides a free download to one of the chapters.

Chapter 1. The Fluctuation.This chapter covered the [flash crash of 1962](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Slide_of_1962) in particular, the May 28<sup>th</sup>/29<sup>th</sup> crash. The chapter opens with a brief history of the stock exchange which then goes on to give information on the drop in the Dow Jones and the volumes of trades which occurred and compare them briefly to the 1929 crash for the week of Maz 21<sup>st</sup> to May 25<sup>th</sup>. After a brief explanation of how news of trades was communicated back in the day, the writer goes into detail about the delays occurring on the stock exchange ticker and the panic that was slowly taking over investors. After going on to mention the potential effect(s) of mutual funds and margin calls on the stock market, Brooks continues the story as the stock market goes into tuesday
