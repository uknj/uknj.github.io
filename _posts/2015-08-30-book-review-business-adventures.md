title: Book Review! Business Adventures, by John Brooks.
---

The first of what will hopefully be many reviews of books that I find intriguing and/or entertaining.

[Business Adventures](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4191136-business-adventures) is quite an old book, having been published in 1969. Regardless, I still found several facts surprisingly relevant to modern businesses and believe that the information and knowledge collected can be used even in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.

The author, John Brooks (1920â€“1993) was a writer and longtime contributor to The New Yorker magazine, where he worked for many years as a staff writer, specializing in financial topics. Brooks was also the author of several books, both fiction and non-fiction, the best known of which was an examination of the financial shenanigans of the 1960s Wall Street bull market.<sup>[1]</sup>

Bill Gates has claimed it is "The best business book I've ever read"<sup>[2]</sup>. It was first given to him by Warren Buffet back in 1991. Bill Gates has reviewed the book and it can be found [here](http://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Business-Adventures). He even provides a free download to one of the chapters.
